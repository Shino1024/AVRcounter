<font size="16">
Small application for an AVR microcontroller to count the microswitch presses. The application will
be soon written and tested on the Arduino Mega2560 board.

It'll be possible to display the number on the external screen. There will be a few options possible,
including the old-school 7-segment display, the PCD8544 Nokia 5110 screen, as well as standard
LCD1602 screen. The "Arduino" C++ language is going to be used.
